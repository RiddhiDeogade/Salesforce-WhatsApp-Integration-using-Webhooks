🔁 Full Setup to Create Salesforce Webhook for Twilio Integration
🔧 Prerequisites:
You have a Salesforce Developer Org (sign up here: https://developer.salesforce.com/signup)

You are familiar with basic Salesforce navigation

## ✅ PART 1: Create a Salesforce Site
Salesforce Sites allow you to expose Apex classes as public endpoints.

🔹 Step 1.1: Enable Sites
Go to Setup

In Quick Find, search: Sites

Click Sites, then click "New"

🔹 Step 1.2: Configure the Site
Field	Value Example
Site Label	TwilioIntegrationSite
Site Name	TwilioIntegrationSite
Site Contact	[Select your admin user]
Default Web Address	twiliointegration (will be part of URL)
Active	✅ Check it
Active Site Home Page	InMaintenance or UnderConstruction
Click Save	

After saving, you’ll get a Site URL like:

arduino
Copy code
https://yourdomain-dev-ed.my.site.com/twiliointegration
## ✅ PART 2: Create Apex Class for Webhook
🔹 Step 2.1: Go to Developer Console
Click the gear icon (⚙️) → Developer Console

File → New → Apex Class

Name it: TwilioWebhook

🔹 Step 2.2: Paste This Code:
apex

    @RestResource(urlMapping='/TwilioWebhook/*')
    global with sharing class TwilioWebhook {
        @HttpPost
        global static void handleIncoming() {
            RestRequest req = RestContext.request;
            String from = req.params.get('From');
            String body = req.params.get('Body');
    
            // Log received message
            System.debug('Incoming from: ' + from + ', Message: ' + body);
    
            // Optional: Create a record or reply
        }
    }

Click Public Access Settings

Under Enabled Apex Class Access:
